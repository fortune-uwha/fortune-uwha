As a Data analyst, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and save costs.

I am experienced in machine learning, supervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use SQL, Python, Microsoft PowerBI and Tableau for my data projects.
