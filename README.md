## Hello👋🏾. Thank you for visiting my profile 👩🏾‍💻

<img src="https://github.com/fortune-uwha/fortune-uwha/blob/main/Github-Image.png" alt="banner that says Hi, I'm Fortune Uwha - I want to help others to make the right decisions, data-driven decisions alongside a cartoon illustration of Fortune">

As a Data analyst, I translate data into valuable and comprehensible insights. My goal is to improve results, make the right decisions and save costs.

I am experienced in machine learning, supervised algorithms and use data visualization techniques to present the results. I use SQL, Python, Microsoft PowerBI and Tableau for my data projects.
